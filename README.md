This is a lightweight, bespoke Google App Script application for converting Google Sheets to PDF.

To add this script to your Google Sheet:
  1. In your Google Sheet file, in the top menu go to Tools >> Script Editor
  2. Copy and Paste the contents of PDFMaker.txt into the Script Editor Window

This should add a new menu item to your sheet, called PDF Maker. The first time you run it, it will raise a security warning. You will have to click on "advanced" to allow all permissions.

Thanks for using this PDF Maker!
